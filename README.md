## PokeAPI
This project utilises React.js for page-rendering and routing. It uses axios to make API calls to the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), and I used npm and Node with Visual Studio Code in my dev environment. I also used SASS to create the stylesheet, utilising the Live Sass Compiler plugin to have it automatically compiled to CSS.
